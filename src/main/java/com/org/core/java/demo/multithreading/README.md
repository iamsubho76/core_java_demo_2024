## Difference between synchronized and ReentrantLock?

Both `synchronized` blocks and `ReentrantLock` provide mechanisms for thread synchronization in Java, but they differ in their features, behavior, and usage. Here are some key differences between them:

1. **Locking Mechanism**:
    - `synchronized`: Uses intrinsic locking provided by the Java language itself. When a thread enters a `synchronized` block, it automatically acquires the lock associated with the monitor object.
    - `ReentrantLock`: Uses explicit locking with a `Lock` object. Threads must explicitly acquire and release the lock using the `lock()` and `unlock()` methods provided by the `ReentrantLock` class.

2. **Reentrancy**:
    - Both `synchronized` blocks and `ReentrantLock` support reentrant behavior, meaning that a thread can acquire the same lock multiple times without deadlocking itself.
    - In `synchronized` blocks, reentrancy is automatically handled by the Java runtime.
    - In `ReentrantLock`, reentrancy is explicit and must be managed by the programmer. The `ReentrantLock` class provides the `lock()` and `unlock()` methods to handle reentrant locking.

3. **Fairness**:
    - `synchronized`: Follows an implicit fairness policy, where threads acquire the lock in the order they request it (first-come, first-served).
    - `ReentrantLock`: Supports both fair and non-fair locking policies. Fair locking ensures that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it, while non-fair locking does not guarantee any particular ordering.

4. **Interruptible Locking**:
    - `synchronized`: Does not support interruption of threads waiting to acquire the lock. Once a thread enters a `synchronized` block, it cannot be interrupted until it exits the block.
    - `ReentrantLock`: Supports interruption of threads waiting to acquire the lock. Threads waiting to acquire the lock can be interrupted by calling the `interrupt()` method on the waiting thread.

5. **Lock Conditions**:
    - `ReentrantLock` provides additional features such as lock conditions (`Condition` objects) which allow threads to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding. This feature is not available with `synchronized` blocks.

6. **Performance**:
    - In most cases, `synchronized` blocks tend to have better performance than `ReentrantLock` due to their built-in optimizations by the JVM. However, in highly contended scenarios, `ReentrantLock` with fair locking may offer better fairness and predictability.

In summary, while `synchronized` blocks are simpler to use and understand, `ReentrantLock` provides more flexibility and control over thread synchronization, especially in complex scenarios where fine-grained locking or advanced features like interruptible locking and lock conditions are required. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.

## Difference between Semaphore, CyclicBarrier, CountDownLatch, and ExecutorService

`Semaphore`, `CyclicBarrier`, `CountDownLatch`, and `ExecutorService` are all concurrency utilities provided by the Java `java.util.concurrent` package, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics. Here's a detailed comparison of each:

1. **Semaphore**:
   - **Purpose**: A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that limits the number of concurrent threads accessing a shared resource. It maintains a set of permits and allows threads to acquire and release permits.
   - **Usage**: Semaphores are often used to control access to a shared resource with a limited capacity, such as connection pools or thread pools.
   - **Characteristics**:
      - Acquiring a permit is non-exclusive; multiple threads can acquire permits simultaneously (up to the available number of permits).
      - Acquiring a permit blocks if no permits are available, and threads wait until a permit becomes available or until interrupted.
      - Semaphores support both fair and non-fair policies for granting permits.
   - **Example**: Controlling access to a database connection pool.

2. **CyclicBarrier**:
   - **Purpose**: A cyclic barrier is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other at a predefined barrier point before proceeding together.
   - **Usage**: Cyclic barriers are often used when multiple threads need to perform independent computations and then synchronize at a common barrier point before proceeding.
   - **Characteristics**:
      - A cyclic barrier is initialized with a fixed number of parties (threads).
      - Threads wait at the barrier until all parties have reached it, at which point the barrier is tripped, and the threads can proceed.
      - After the barrier is tripped, it resets automatically, and threads can reuse it for subsequent cycles.
   - **Example**: Parallel computing tasks where multiple threads perform independent computations and then synchronize to combine results.

3. **CountDownLatch**:
   - **Purpose**: A countdown latch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed by other threads completes.
   - **Usage**: Countdown latches are often used when a set of threads need to wait for the completion of a set of tasks before proceeding.
   - **Characteristics**:
      - A countdown latch is initialized with an initial count.
      - Threads decrement the count using the `countDown()` method when they complete their tasks.
      - Threads waiting at the latch using the `await()` method block until the count reaches zero, at which point they are released.
   - **Example**: Main thread waiting for completion of initialization tasks performed by worker threads.

4. **ExecutorService**:
   - **Purpose**: An executor service is a higher-level concurrency utility for managing and executing tasks asynchronously.
   - **Usage**: Executor services are used to decouple task submission from task execution and provide features such as thread pooling, task scheduling, and task cancellation.
   - **Characteristics**:
      - Executor services manage a pool of worker threads and execute tasks submitted to them.
      - They provide various types of executor services, such as `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`, and `ForkJoinPool`.
      - They support features like thread pooling, task queuing, task prioritization, and execution control.
   - **Example**: Concurrent execution of multiple tasks, parallel processing of data, and managing asynchronous computations.

In summary, while all these concurrency utilities provide synchronization mechanisms for coordinating threads, they have different use cases, behaviors, and characteristics. The choice of which utility to use depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.


## Example of deadlock and strive with proper example java

Sure, let's start with a simple example of a deadlock scenario followed by an example demonstrating how to avoid deadlock using a strategy called "strive".

### Example of Deadlock:

In a deadlock scenario, two or more threads are waiting for resources that are held by each other, resulting in a circular dependency. Here's a classic example of a deadlock involving two threads and two locks:

```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired lock1");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired lock2");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired lock2");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired lock1");
                }
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, `Thread 1` locks `lock1` and then attempts to acquire `lock2`, while `Thread 2` locks `lock2` and then attempts to acquire `lock1`. Both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock they need, resulting in a deadlock.

### Example of Strive (Avoiding Deadlock):

To avoid deadlock, you can ensure that threads acquire locks in a consistent order. One common approach is to assign a global ordering of locks and always acquire them in that order.

```java
public class StriveExample {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired lock1");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired lock2");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired lock1");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired lock2");
                }
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, both `Thread 1` and `Thread 2` acquire `lock1` before `lock2`, ensuring a consistent order of lock acquisition. This prevents the possibility of a circular dependency and avoids deadlock.

While the "strive" approach can effectively prevent deadlocks, it requires careful design and coordination to ensure that locks are acquired in a consistent order throughout the application.


## Example of race condition with proper example

A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of concurrent operations. It typically arises in a multithreaded environment where two or more threads access shared resources concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the order of execution of these threads. Here's a simple example of a race condition in Java:

```java
public class RaceConditionExample {
    private static int counter = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                counter++;
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                counter++;
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // Wait for threads to complete
        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final counter value: " + counter);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We have a shared variable `counter` initialized to 0.
- We create two threads (`thread1` and `thread2`) that increment the `counter` variable 10,000 times each.
- Both threads are started concurrently.
- Due to the interleaved execution of threads, the increments performed by one thread may be overwritten by the other thread, leading to incorrect results.
- The final value of `counter` printed at the end may vary unpredictably between runs, demonstrating the race condition.

To fix this race condition, you can use synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or `AtomicInteger` to ensure that access to the shared variable is properly synchronized between threads. Here's the same example using `AtomicInteger` to avoid the race condition:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class RaceConditionFixedExample {
    private static AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                counter.incrementAndGet();
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                counter.incrementAndGet();
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // Wait for threads to complete
        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final counter value: " + counter);
    }
}
```

In this fixed example, `AtomicInteger` is used instead of `int` for the `counter` variable. `AtomicInteger` provides atomic operations, ensuring that increments are performed atomically without the risk of race conditions.
