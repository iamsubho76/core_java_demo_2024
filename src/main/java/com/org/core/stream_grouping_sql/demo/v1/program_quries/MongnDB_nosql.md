1.What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability, high availability, and performance.

2. What is sharding in mongodb

Database sharding in MongoDB is a method of horizontal scaling that involves partitioning data across
multiple servers or shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data, allowing MongoDB to handle larger
datasets and higher throughput. Let's illustrate this with an example:

Suppose we have a MongoDB deployment for an e-commerce application that stores product information. The
database contains a collection called products, which stores information about various products, such as
name, category, price, and quantity.

Initially, the products collection is stored on a single MongoDB server, but as the dataset grows, we
decide to shard the collection to distribute the data across multiple servers for better scalability.

Here's how we would implement database sharding in MongoDB with an example:

Enable Sharding:
First, we need to enable sharding on our MongoDB deployment. We configure the config servers and enable
sharding for the database containing the products collection.

Choose Shard Key:
We need to select a shard key for the products collection. Since we anticipate a high volume of queries
for products by category, we choose the category field as our shard key.

Add Shards:
Next, we add one or more shards to the sharded cluster. Each shard can be a standalone replica set or a
standalone server. For simplicity, let's assume we start with two shards.

Distribute Data:
As new products are inserted into the products collection, MongoDB automatically partitions and
distributes the data across the shards based on the shard key (category).
For example:

javascript
Copy code
// Inserting a product into the collection
db.products.insertOne({
   name: "Smartphone",
   category: "Electronics",
   price: 500,
   quantity: 100
})
Based on the category field, MongoDB determines which shard to store the document on. For instance,
the above document might be stored on Shard 1 if the category is "Electronics".

Route Queries:
Applications connect to the query router (mongos), which routes queries to the appropriate shard based on
the shard key specified in the query. For example:

javascript
Copy code
// Querying products by category
db.products.find({ category: "Electronics" })
The query router routes this query to the shard containing the data for the "Electronics" category.

Scale Out:
As the dataset and query load increase, we can add more shards to the cluster to distribute the
load evenly and maintain performance. We can also adjust the shard key or add indexes to optimize
query performance.

By sharding the products collection in MongoDB, we achieve horizontal scalability, allowing our
e-commerce application to handle a growing number of products and serve a larger number of users while
maintaining performance and availability.

3.Explain the structure of a MongoDB document.

MongoDB documents are JSON-like data structures composed of field and value pairs. The field is the key and the value can be various data types including other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

4.What is a replica set in MongoDB?

A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and high availability. It consists of primary and secondary nodes, along with optional arbiter nodes for tie-breaking.
How does MongoDB ensure high availability in a replica set?

MongoDB ensures high availability by automatically electing a new primary node if the current one fails. This is possible due to the replication of data across multiple nodes in the replica set.
Explain MongoDB sharding.

Sharding is a method used to distribute data across multiple machines to improve scalability. MongoDB achieves this by partitioning data across shards, each responsible for a subset of the data.
What is the difference between sharding and replication in MongoDB?

Replication provides redundancy and high availability by maintaining multiple copies of data across different nodes. Sharding, on the other hand, distributes data across multiple servers to improve scalability and performance.
How do you perform aggregation in MongoDB?

Aggregation in MongoDB is done using the aggregate() method, which allows you to perform operations like grouping, filtering, and computing aggregate values on collections.
What is an index in MongoDB?

Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in other databases. They improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate and retrieve documents from a collection.
Explain the different types of indexes in MongoDB.

MongoDB supports various types of indexes including single-field, compound, multi-key, text, geospatial, and hashed indexes, each optimized for different types of queries.
How do you create an index in MongoDB?

Indexes can be created using the createIndex() method on a collection. You can specify the fields to index and options like ascending or descending order.
What is the significance of covered queries in MongoDB?

Covered queries are queries where all the fields needed by the query are present in an index, allowing MongoDB to fulfill the query using only the index without needing to examine the actual documents.
Explain the concept of TTL indexes in MongoDB.

TTL (Time To Live) indexes in MongoDB allow you to automatically expire documents from a collection after a specified period of time, which can be useful for managing data that has a

Example:

==>
db.places.createIndex({ "location": "2dsphere" })
How do you perform bulk operations in MongoDB?

Bulk operations allow you to perform multiple insert, update, or delete operations in a single request, which can be more efficient than executing individual operations.
Example:

==>
const bulkOps = [
   { insertOne: { document: { name: "Product 1" } } },
   { updateOne: { filter: { name: "Product 2" }, update: { $set: { price: 20 } } } },
   { deleteOne: { filter: { name: "Product 3" } } }
];
db.products.bulkWrite(bulkOps);
Explain the explain() method in MongoDB.

The explain() method provides information about how MongoDB executes a query, including the chosen query plan and the index used, if any.
Example:

==>
db.orders.find({ "status": "completed" }).explain("executionStats")
What is the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?

The aggregation pipeline is a framework for performing aggregation operations on MongoDB collections. It consists of stages that process documents sequentially.

   { $match: { status: "completed" } },
   { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
])
How do you perform transactions in MongoDB?

MongoDB supports multi-document transactions for operations on multiple documents within a single replica set or a sharded cluster.
Example:

==>
const session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();
try {
    db.collection1.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $set: { status: "processed" } });
    db.collection2.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $set: { status: "processed" } });
    session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
    session.abortTransaction();
} finally {
    session.endSession();
}
What is the aggregation function $out used for in MongoDB?

The $out stage in the aggregation pipeline writes the resulting documents to a specified collection. It is often used to store the output of aggregation operations in a new collection.
Example:

==>
db.orders.aggregate([
   { $match: { status: "completed" } },
   { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
   { $out: "customer_totals" }
])
Explain the db.collection.createIndex() method in MongoDB.

The createIndex() method creates indexes on collections to improve query performance. You can specify the fields to index and options like ascending or descending order.
Example:

==>
db.orders.createIndex({ "customer_id": 1 })
How do you perform case-insensitive queries in MongoDB?

MongoDB supports case-insensitive queries using regular expressions with the $regex operator.
Example:

db.users.find({ "username": { $regex: /^john$/i } })
What is the $redact aggregation stage used for in MongoDB?

The $redact stage in the aggregation pipeline selectively restricts the content of documents based on specified conditions.
Example:

==>
db.sales.aggregate([
   {
      $redact: {
         $cond: {
            if: { $eq: ["$level", 1] },
            then: "$$DESCEND",
            else: "$$PRUNE"
         }
      }
   }
])
Explain the concept of session handling in MongoDB.

Sessions in MongoDB are used to support transactions and causal consistency across multiple operations.
Example:

==>
const session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();
// Perform operations
session.commitTransaction();
session.endSession();
What is the difference between a capped collection and a regular collection in MongoDB?

A capped collection has a fixed size and maintains insertion order, acting like a circular buffer. Once the collection reaches its maximum size, older documents are overwritten.
Example:

==>
db.createCollection("logs", { capped: true, size: 100000 })
How do you perform text indexing in MongoDB?

Text indexing in MongoDB allows for efficient full-text search queries on text fields in a collection.
Example:

==>
db.articles.createIndex({ "content": "text" })
Explain the db.collection.watch() method in MongoDB.

The watch() method enables change streams, which allow applications to receive real-time notifications of changes to data in MongoDB collections.
Example:

==>
const changeStream = db.collection.watch();
changeStream.on("change", change => {
   console.log("Change:", change);
});
How do you perform aggregation with the $facet stage in MongoDB?

      $facet: {
         totalSalesByProduct: [
            { $group: { _id: "$product", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
         ],
         averageSales: [
            { $group: { _id: null, avgAmount: { $avg: "$amount" } } }
         ]
      }
   }
])
What is the db.collection.distinct() method used for in MongoDB?

The distinct() method returns an array of unique values for a specified field across all documents in a collection.
Example:

==>
db.products.distinct("category")
How do you perform geospatial queries in MongoDB?

MongoDB supports various geospatial queries like finding points within a certain distance of a given location or finding polygons that intersect with a given area.
Example:

==>
db.places.find({
   location: {
      $near: {
         $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },
         $maxDistance: 5000
      }
   }
})
What is the $graphLookup aggregation stage used for in MongoDB?

The $graphLookup stage performs a recursive search on a collection's graph-like data, such as parent-child relationships.
Example:

==>
db.organizations.aggregate([
   {
      $graphLookup: {
         from: "organizations",
         startWith: "$parent",
         connectFromField: "parent",
         connectToField: "_id",
         as: "descendants"
      }
   }
])
Explain the concept of partial indexes in MongoDB.

Partial indexes are indexes that only index documents that meet specified filter criteria. They can reduce index size and improve query performance.
Example:

==>
db.products.createIndex(
   { "stock_quantity": 1 },
   { partialFilterExpression: { "stock_quantity": { $exists: true } } }
)
How do you perform array updates in MongoDB?

MongoDB supports various array update operators like $push, $addToSet, $pull, and $pop to update arrays within documents.
Example:

==>
db.users.updateOne(
   { _id: 1 },
   { $push: { hobbies: "Hiking" } }
)
What is the db.collection.createView() method used for in MongoDB?

The createView() method creates a view based on an aggregation pipeline. Views allow for the execution of complex queries as if they were simple read operations.
Example:

==>
db.createView("customer_contacts", "customers", [
   { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, email: 1 } }
])
Explain the concept of time-to-live (TTL) indexes in MongoDB.

TTL indexes automatically delete documents from a collection after a specified period of time. They are useful for managing data that should expire after a certain time.
Example:

==>
db.sessions.createIndex({ "createdAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 })
How do you perform conditional updates in MongoDB?

MongoDB supports the $set operator with the $cond operator to perform conditional updates based on specified conditions.
Example:

==>
db.products.updateOne(
   { _id: 1, quantity: { $gt: 0 } },
   { $set: { status: "available" } }
)
What is the MongoDB Atlas and how does it work?

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that provides automated backups, scaling, and monitoring. It allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB databases with ease.
Example:

==>
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const uri = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.example.com/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
client.connect(err => {
   const collection = client.db("test").collection("devices");
   // perform operations
   client.close();
});
These questions cover a wide range of topics in MongoDB, from basic querying to advanced aggregation, indexing, transactions, and more.
